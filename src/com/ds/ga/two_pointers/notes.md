## Basic Concepts ##

** When to apply 2 pointers ** 
1. When we need to iterate over a linear data structure like Array, String, Linked list etc. 
2. When we need to focus on finding elements in a specific range within the data as given by the positions
of the two pointers. 

** When can it not be used ** 
1. When we are not iterating over a linear data structure. 
2. Eliminating one solution does not automatically eliminate the other solution. We need to have an exhaustive search over solutions.
