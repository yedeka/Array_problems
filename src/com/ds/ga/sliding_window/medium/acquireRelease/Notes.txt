Acquire release strategy
Used in sliding window problems where the window length is variable. This means that we will
have to change the sliding window based on some condition. Best example for this is Maximum
consecutive Ones III problem of leetcode. This is done by keeping 2 pointers right and left.
left pointer is the one which is at an index that is released and right pointer is
the one that is about to be acquired and we should always have a valid window between left+1
and right - 1. Initialize left at -1 and right at 0. Size of window is i-1-j
